    <h1>You can write your thoughts here</h1>
    <h2>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</h2>
    <h3>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</h3>
    <h4>I mean, like what is his deal?</h4>
    <h5>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...</h5>

            <p>Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children
                divs</p>
            <div>
                <p>Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.</p>

    <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
            <ul>
                <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>
